    <span className="text-yellow-300">Q9:</span> Is the EMI formula different for zero‑interest loans?
              </h3>
              <p>
                If the rate is truly 0%, EMI simplifies to principal divided by months—no compounding interest.

                Use the built‑in comparison panel: adjust the rate and tenure for Loan B and compare EMI, total interest, and total payment.

                Yes. The formula and reducing‑balance method mirror standard bank and NBFC practice.
